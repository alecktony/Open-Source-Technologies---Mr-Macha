                  <b>What is Web Security?</b> -- Web security is also known as “Cybersecurity”. It basically means protecting a website or web application by detecting, preventing and responding to cyber threats.
                  Websites and web applications are just as prone to security breaches as physical homes, stores, and government locations. Unfortunately, cybercrime happens every day, and great web security measures are needed to protect websites and web applications from becoming compromised.

               <p><b>Details of Web Security</b>
      There are a lot of factors that go into web security and web protection. Any website or application that is secure is surely backed by different types of checkpoints and techniques for keeping it safe.

There are a variety of security standards that must be followed at all times, and these standards are implemented and highlighted by the OWASP. Most experienced web developers from top cybersecurity companies will follow the standards of the OWASP as well as keep a close eye on the Web Hacking Incident Database to see when, how, and why different people are hacking different websites and services.

               Thus, web security is easy to install and it also helps the business people to make their website safe and secure. A web application firewall prevents automated attacks that usually target small or lesser-known websites. These attacks are born out by malicious bots or malware that automatically scan for vulnerabilities they can misuse, or cause DDoS attacks that slow down or crash your website.

Thus, Web security is extremely important, especially for websites or web applications that deal with confidential, private, or protected information. Security methods are evolving to match the different types of vulnerabilities that come into existence.
