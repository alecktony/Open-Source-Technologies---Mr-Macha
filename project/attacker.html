                  <b>What is Cyber Attack?</b> --A cyber attack is an attempt to disable computers, steal data, or use a breached computer system to launch additional attacks. Cybercriminals use different methods to launch a cyber attack that includes malware, phishing, ransomware, man-in-the-middle attack, or other methods.
               </p>
               <p>
             A cyber attack is when an individual or an organization deliberately and maliciously attempts to breach the information system of another individual or organization. While there is usually an economic goal, some recent attacks show destruction of data as a goal.

Malicious actors often look for ransom, or other kinds of economic gain, but attacks can be perpetrated with an array of motives, including political activism purposes.

   				  <b>Types Of Cyber Attack</b>
   				  <p>
   				  <b>Malware</b>

Malware is a term that describes malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. Malware breaches a network through a vulnerability, typically when a user clicks a dangerous link or email attachment that then installs risky software.
               </p>
                 <p>
   				  <b>Phishing</b>

Phishing is the method of sending fraudulent communications that seems to come from a reputable source, usually through email. The goal is to steal or get sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine. Phishing is an increasingly common cyberthreat.
               </p>
                 <p>
   				  <b>Man-In-The-Middle</b>

Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, also called eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. Once the attackers interrupt the traffic, they can filter and steal data.

Two common points of entry for MitM attacks:

    On unsecure public Wi-Fi, attackers can insert themselves between a visitor’s device and the network. Without knowing, the visitor passes all information through the attacker.
    Once malware has breached a device; an attacker can install software to process all of the victim’s information. 
               </p>
                 <p>
   				  <b>SQL Injection</b>

A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection happens when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not. An attacker could carry out a SQL injection simply by submitting malicious code into a vulnerable website search box.               </p>
